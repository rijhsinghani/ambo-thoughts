          <h2>Deacon Henry Cugini</h2>
          <p><strong>Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey</strong></p>

          <p>
            Deacon Henry Cugini serves the faithful of the Diocese of Trenton,
            bringing the Gospel message to life through preaching, teaching, and
            acts of charity. Ordained as a permanent deacon, Henry is dedicated
            to bridging the sacred and the everyday — meeting people where they
            are and walking alongside them in their faith journey.
          </p>

          <h3>Ministry</h3>
          <p>
            As a deacon, Henry's ministry spans three pillars: the Word, the
            Liturgy, and Charity. He regularly preaches at Sunday Mass, leads
            Bible study groups, and serves in outreach ministries that support
            the poor and marginalized. His homilies are known for their warmth,
            practical wisdom, and deep scriptural grounding.
          </p>

          <h3>About This Site</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Ambo Thoughts</em> takes its name from the ambo — the stand from
            which Scripture is proclaimed and the homily is preached. This site
            extends that ministry beyond the parish walls, sharing reflections,
            homilies, and video content for anyone seeking to deepen their
            faith.
          </p>
