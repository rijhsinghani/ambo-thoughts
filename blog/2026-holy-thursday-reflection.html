          <p>
            Tonight we gather to remember. Not simply to recall an event from
            two thousand years ago, but to enter into a living memory — a moment
            that continues to shape who we are and how we are called to live.
          </p>

          <h2>The Unexpected King</h2>

          <p>
            Picture the scene: the disciples are gathered in the upper room.
            They know something significant is happening — the Passover meal
            carries the weight of centuries of tradition. But then Jesus does
            something none of them expect.
          </p>

          <p>
            He takes off his outer garment, wraps a towel around his waist, and
            begins to wash their feet.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "Do you realize what I have done for you? You call me 'teacher' and
            'master,' and rightly so, for indeed I am. If I, therefore, the
            master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one
            another's feet." — John 13:12-14
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            In the ancient world, washing feet was the task of the lowest
            servant in the household. It was dirty, humble work. No one of
            status would ever do it. And yet here is Jesus — the one they call
            Lord and Teacher — on his knees before them.
          </p>

          <h2>Peter's Resistance</h2>

          <p>
            Peter's reaction is immediate and very human: "You will never wash
            my feet!" We can hear the discomfort in his voice. This isn't how
            things are supposed to work. Leaders don't serve — they are served.
          </p>

          <p>
            But that's precisely the point. Jesus is redefining leadership,
            redefining greatness, redefining what it means to love. And he's not
            just teaching with words — he's demonstrating with action.
          </p>

          <h2>What This Means for Us</h2>

          <p>So what does foot-washing look like in 2026? It looks like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The parent who gets up in the middle of the night with a sick
              child
            </li>
            <li>
              The neighbor who shovels the elderly couple's driveway before they
              wake up
            </li>
            <li>
              The volunteer at the food pantry who treats every person with
              dignity
            </li>
            <li>
              The friend who listens — truly listens — when someone is hurting
            </li>
            <li>
              The stranger who stops to help when it would be easier to keep
              walking
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Foot-washing is every act of humble, self-giving love that puts
            another person's needs before our own comfort. It is the daily,
            unglamorous, often unnoticed work of being present to one another.
          </p>

          <h2>The Eucharist and Service</h2>

          <p>
            Tonight we also celebrate the institution of the Eucharist. And it's
            no coincidence that John's Gospel pairs the washing of the feet with
            the Last Supper. The two are inseparable. We receive the Body of
            Christ at this table so that we can become the Body of Christ in the
            world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every time we gather around this altar, we are being formed — shaped
            — into servants. We come to be fed, and we leave to feed others.
          </p>

          <h3>A Prayer for Tonight</h3>

          <blockquote>
            Lord Jesus, you knelt before your disciples and washed their feet.
            Give us the grace to kneel before one another in service. Help us to
            see your face in everyone we meet. Make us instruments of your
            humble love in a world that desperately needs it. Amen.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            My brothers and sisters, on this holy night, let us receive the
            great gift of the Eucharist. And let us go forth to wash one
            another's feet — in our homes, our workplaces, our communities, and
            wherever God calls us to serve.
          </p>
