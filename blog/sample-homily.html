          <p>
            Every one of us has been both the man left on the road and the one
            who passed by. The parable of the Good Samaritan is not just a story
            about someone else — it's a mirror held up to our own lives.
          </p>

          <h2>The Question That Started It All</h2>

          <p>
            A scholar of the law asks Jesus: "Who is my neighbor?" It seems like
            a simple question, but beneath it lies a deeper one: "Who am I
            <em>not</em> responsible for?" The scholar wants to draw a line. He
            wants limits to love.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jesus answers with a story that erases every line we try to draw.
          </p>

          <h2>Three Travelers, One Road</h2>

          <p>
            A man lies beaten and half-dead on the road from Jerusalem to
            Jericho. Three people pass by:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>The priest</strong> — a religious leader, someone who
              should know better. He sees the man and crosses to the other side.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Levite</strong> — a temple assistant, steeped in the
              law. He too passes by.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Samaritan</strong> — a foreigner, an outsider, someone
              the Jewish audience would have despised. And he is the one who
              stops.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The Samaritan doesn't just feel compassion — he acts on it. He
            bandages the man's wounds, puts him on his own animal, takes him to
            an inn, and pays for his care. He gives his time, his resources, and
            his comfort for a stranger.
          </p>

          <h2>Who Is Our Neighbor Today?</h2>

          <p>
            In our world of gated communities and social media bubbles, it's
            easy to "cross to the other side." We do it every day:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>We scroll past the news story about a family in crisis</li>
            <li>
              We avoid eye contact with the person asking for help on the street
              corner
            </li>
            <li>
              We hesitate to reach out to the coworker who seems to be
              struggling
            </li>
            <li>
              We stay in our comfort zones, surrounded by people who look and
              think like us
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The parable challenges us to ask not "Who is my neighbor?" but "To
            whom can I <em>be</em> a neighbor?"
          </p>

          <h2>The Courage to Stop</h2>

          <p>
            Being a Good Samaritan requires courage. It requires interrupting
            our schedule, stepping out of our comfort zone, and risking
            inconvenience. The priest and the Levite had their reasons for
            passing by — perhaps ritual purity laws, perhaps fear, perhaps
            simple busyness. We always have reasons.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "The question is not, 'If I stop to help this man, what will happen
            to me?' The question is, 'If I do not stop to help this man, what
            will happen to him?'" — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This Lent, I invite each of us to look for the person on the road.
            They might be in our own family, our neighborhood, our parish, or on
            the other side of the world. And when we see them, may we have the
            grace to stop.
          </p>
